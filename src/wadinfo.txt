Description             : Happy Halloween!

                          It's been two days since
                          You've escaped that evil
                          mansion. You're low on food
                          and supplies (including ammo).

                          Tired of foraging in the woods
                          you hop on a freight train
                          and hope it's taking you
                          towards the city.

                          You're thinking about how
                          to explain what you saw to the
                          authorities, when the train
                          begins to shake. Better hold
                          on! This thing's gonna crash!
